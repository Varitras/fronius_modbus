"""Every module is type-checked, or says in one line why it is not yet.

The mypy scope in pyproject.toml was frozen at the modules that were clean
when the gate was adopted. Nothing would otherwise stop a module added to the
package from simply not being checked - the job stays green because the file
is never named, which is the same shape as a guard that goes blind.

This does not demand that everything be typed. It demands that leaving a
module out be a decision somebody wrote down.

The scope is READ from pyproject.toml rather than repeated here. A copy would
be the second place the list lives, and the first to drift.
